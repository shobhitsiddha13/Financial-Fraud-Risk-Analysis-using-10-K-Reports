Project: Financial Fraud Risk Analysis using 10-K Reports

Objective:
To detect financial anomalies and potential fraud indicators by analyzing 10-K filings of public companies using NLP and data analytics.

Steps:
1. Download 10-K reports from SEC EDGAR for selected companies (e.g., Apple, Tesla).
2. Clean the HTML content and extract relevant sections like Managementâ€™s Discussion and Financial Statements.
3. Use NLP (tokenization, regex) to extract financial terms, monetary values, and metrics.
4. Structure data into year-wise values (Revenue, Debt, Net Income, etc.).
5. Perform financial ratio analysis (YoY growth, debt-to-revenue, etc.).
6. Apply Isolation Forest to detect anomalies in financial trends.
7. Visualize financial data trends and anomaly points.
8. Export results to CSV and generate visual plots for insights.

Tools & Libraries:
- Python, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, NLTK

Outcome:
Identified unusual financial behavior such as sudden debt spikes or manipulated revenue trends, potentially signaling accounting irregularities or fraud.

Ideal Use:
Supports forensic accountants, financial analysts, and regulators in identifying risky firms.
